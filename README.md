# Non-WEIRD-WEB

This app contains a summary of data to inform whether web-based studies are feasible for non-WEIRD countries; i.e. countries that are do not belong to the group of countries that are considered "western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic" following Heinrich et al. (2010). Data come (at this moment) from the World Bank accessed via the WDI package (Arel-Bundock, 2021) including information about the availability of mobile phones and laptops, average internet bandwidth etc.

The data are still sparse and there are probably many indicators worth adding. Please email me if you think there is data worth adding (jens.roser@ntu.ac.uk).

A proto-type is here:
